Working in theoretical atomic physics and particle astrophysics. My research focusses on high-precision atomic structure calculations, and how atomic processes can be used for testing fundamental theories, probing for physics beyond the standard model, and searching for dark matter.

**Research Interests**
 * Atomic structure theory
 * Low-energy tests of fundamental physics
 * Dark matter
 * Particle astrophysics
